## We collect the following

### User id
When you use the bot, your Telegram id may be recorded and associated with the bot.  
There are currently a few actions that log user ids:  

- Customizing reply formats
- Generating a telegraph page
- When exporting all of an artist's work
- Favorites function (coming soon)
- Pushing the artist's work (coming soon)

In all other operations, bot does not record your information and does not associate the work you send with your id in any way.

### IP
bot / Cloudflare may obtain your current IP when you do the following  

- Accessing the telegraph page (not live preview)
    - Cloudflare provides a direct link to the original image
    - bot provides a direct link to the moving image

> (Telegraph pages are only opened in a browser, Telegram Instant Preview will not pass any traffic through the service)
- Accessing this document


## Secure
bot does not have any user tracking links and does not disclose your usage habits to third parties. It runs on the same source code as the Github version, so if you think this promise is false, consider building your own service using the source code.

## Revisions
The privacy policy may be modified at any time, if you continue to use this bot, you continue to agree to the terms of the privacy policy.
